/**
 * Series 2 XBee.  Super class of all Receive packets.
 * <p/>
 * Note: ZNet RX packets do not include RSSI since it is a mesh network and potentially requires several
 * hops to get to the destination.  The RSSI of the last hop is available using the DB AT command.
 * If your network is not mesh (i.e. composed of a single coordinator and end devices -- no routers) 
 * then the DB command should provide accurate RSSI.

This is a Toyotomi HVAC remote controller library, for the Arduino platform 
based on the CoAP protocol.

Created as a project in one of the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department 
(University of Patras) courses, called "Distributed Systems II". It is based on 
Kontodimas’s ‘Toyotomi’ library and uses the CoAP protocol to communicate with Uberdust. 
It implements the following operations: ON/OFF, TEMP UP, TEMP DOWN, MODE, FAN.  
Due to the limited memory size of Arduino Pro Mini, the rest operations not supported yet 
(they are included in “not_supported” file, though)
